# A Clunkyard robot in zig

Edit `bot.zig`, build, play a local match and inspect its replay. Install [Node 20+ with npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and your language's compiler or interpreter.
See the [supported platforms and toolchain installers](https://clunkyard.com/sdk/player-kit#supported-platforms).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/clunkyard/starter-zig.git
cd starter-zig
npx @clunkyard/cli doctor
npx @clunkyard/cli build
npx @clunkyard/cli match
npx @clunkyard/cli replay
```

If you use Make, the equivalent commands are `make doctor`, `make`, `make match` and `make replay`. The CLI downloads the local match engine and your language's SDK. Downloads and build output stay in `.clunkyard/`.

This robot builds to WebAssembly (wasm32-wasip1), as the hosted builder does, and runs on the Wasmtime host metered by fuel, which counts the same on every computer. In Season 3 its fuel tier is 1 (rates/s3.json); a local match uses the same fuel budget as Standard. Zig builds the WebAssembly program itself.

Set "target": "native" in bot.json to build with Zig instead. A native build plays Open only: Standard refuses it. Other platforms build natively until their SDK carries the WebAssembly host.

The build recipe is qualified with Zig 0.17.0. Older Zig releases may require syntax or build flag changes.

The [language guide](https://clunkyard.com/sdk/zig) covers the robot API and your toolchain. Use `doctor` to check your installation.

## Repeat a trial

```sh
npx @clunkyard/cli match 42 2d classic
npx @clunkyard/cli match 77 3d zero-g
```

Keep a baseline commit. Repeat several seeds and rulesets; compare contacts, battery, aim, shots, hits and eliminations in the replay. Local trials run programs as your user. Use hosted trials to measure arena budgets before a tournament.

## Play online

Create or copy a bot at [clunkyard.com](https://clunkyard.com). To work with its private Git repository, install `npm install --global @clunkyard/git`, run `clunkyard-git login` and follow the [private Git guide](https://clunkyard.com/sdk/private-git). Copy your robot files into the private clone, then push to save a revision and start a hosted build.

You can also create your own GitHub repository from this template, connect it in My bots and select the repository/ref for build-on-push. [WebDAV](https://clunkyard.com/manual#local-development) is available for desktop editors. Save browser changes before syncing; resolve any source conflict before publishing.

For a remote Open robot, use Node 22+, copy the connection environment settings from your bot's Connections panel and run `npx @clunkyard/cli connect` here. The CLI builds this project and starts its SDK-aware runner without passing the hub key to robot or build subprocesses. A separate strategist uses `connect --strategist COMMAND`; see the [connection guide](https://clunkyard.com/sdk/player-kit#connect-code-running-on-your-computer).
